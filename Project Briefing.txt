# HOF Website Redesign — Contractor Brief

## The Job in One Sentence

Restyle a single-page static HTML site to look and feel like two reference sites — fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile — using the same content and images that already exist.

---

## What You're Working With

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Live site** | [www.hofcriteria.com](https://www.hofcriteria.com) |
| **Hosting** | Netlify (static deploy) |
| **Current code** | Single HTML file with inline CSS |
| **Images** | Hosted on ImageKit.io — use the same URLs |
| **Map image** | Hosted on hanoverco.com — use the same URL |
| **Logos** | Hosted on hanoverco.com — use the same URL |

**You will not need a CMS, database, build tools, or JavaScript framework.** The deliverable is a single HTML file (with CSS inline or in a separate stylesheet) that I deploy to Netlify.

## The Two Reference Sites — "Make It Look Like These"

### Reference 1: [homesteadcapital.com](https://www.homesteadcapital.com/)
**Use this for:** overall visual tone — typography, color palette, spacing, section transitions, stat bar layout, institutional feel.

What I like about it:
- Muted, earthy color palette (cream, gray-green, charcoal)
- Clean sans-serif typography with generous white space
- Stat bar with big numbers ($1.6bn, 4 Funds, ~101K Acres, etc.)
- Custom arrow/divider graphic elements between sections
- Professional, calm, confident feel
- **Look at how this site works on mobile** — the sections stack cleanly and remain readable

### Reference 2: [peaceablestreet.com](https://peaceablestreet.com/)
**Use this for:** section structure and content flow — how they present who they are, track record stats, partner logos, and the clean CRE-fund feel.

What I like about it:
- Dark header/hero with clean white text
- "Track Record" stat bar ($3.9B, 80 Deals, 118 Properties)
- Clean section separation
- Professional team section
- Simple footer with navigation

**Look at BOTH reference sites on your phone before you start designing.** The mobile experience is just as important as desktop.

## IMPORTANT: What NOT to Change

1. **Keep the multi-image layout at the top.** I do NOT want one big hero image like Homestead or Peaceable Street have. My current site shows multiple property images (land, retail, office, campus) — keep that grid/carousel approach. Just make it look better.
2. **Keep ALL existing text content exactly as-is.** Do not rewrite any copy.
3. **Keep ALL existing images.** Use the same ImageKit URLs. Do not download or re-host images.
4. **Keep the same page sections in the same order:**
   - Logo + Fund name
   - Headline + subtitle
   - Property images
   - Acquisition Criteria
   - Target Markets (with map)
   - Team / Connecting
   - Footer with press release link + logo

## What TO Change (the actual work)

### 1. Typography
- Replace current fonts with a clean, institutional sans-serif (e.g., Inter, DM Sans, or similar Google Font)
- Increase type hierarchy contrast — the headline should feel bold and dominant, subheads should be clearly distinct from body text
- Reference Homestead's typography for the right feel
- **Minimum body text size: 16px on mobile.** No tiny text on phones.

### 2. Color Palette
- Move to a more muted, institutional palette — think navy/charcoal/slate with warm accent
- No bright colors. This should feel like a serious real estate fund, not a tech startup
- Reference Homestead (cream/gray/charcoal) or Peaceable Street (navy/white/gold)
- **Ensure sufficient contrast** between text and backgrounds (WCAG AA minimum)

### 3. Spacing and Layout
- Add significantly more white space between sections
- Each section should feel like a distinct "page" when scrolling
- Use full-width section backgrounds (alternating light/dark) to separate sections, similar to both reference sites

### 4. Stat Bar
- Add a prominent stat bar somewhere near the top of the page (similar to Homestead's or Peaceable Street's)
- Stats to display: **$125M** (Fund Size) · **$3M–$20M+** (Deal Size) · **19** (Target Markets)
- Big numbers, small labels underneath. This is a key visual element.
- **On mobile:** stats should stack vertically or wrap into a 2-column grid — do NOT let them shrink to unreadable size

### 5. Property Image Grid
- Keep multiple images but style them into a clean, polished grid or mosaic layout
- Consider subtle hover effects or image overlays with property type labels (desktop only — no hover on mobile)
- No image carousel/slider is required — a static grid is fine
- **On mobile:** images should stack or reflow into a single column. They must not overflow the screen or require horizontal scrolling.

### 6. Acquisition Criteria Section
- Present the criteria (Location, Property Type, Deal Size) in a more visual/card-based layout
- Think Homestead's expandable list items or Peaceable Street's clean section blocks
- Each criterion should feel like its own distinct element, not just text paragraphs
- **On mobile:** cards should stack vertically, full-width

### 7. Target Markets Section
- Give the map image more visual prominence
- Consider placing market lists below or beside the map in a cleaner layout
- Markets should be scannable — possibly as pills/tags or a two-column layout
- **On mobile:** the map image must scale down and remain legible. If the text on the map becomes unreadable at phone widths, place the map as a full-width image that the user can pinch-to-zoom, or consider listing the markets as text beneath a smaller map.

### 8. Team / Contact Section
- Clean, centered layout with headshots, names, and email links
- Reference Peaceable Street's team presentation
- Headshots should be the same size, circular or rounded-square crop
- **On mobile:** team members should stack vertically, centered

### 9. Footer
- Simple, clean footer with Hanover logo, press release link, and any legal text
- Dark background preferred

## Mobile & Responsive Requirements (CRITICAL)

**This site will be shared primarily via email with brokers and property owners who will open it on their phones.** The mobile experience is not secondary — it is equally important to desktop.

### Breakpoints
Design for at least three breakpoints:
- **Desktop:** 1024px and above
- **Tablet:** 768px–1023px
- **Mobile:** below 768px

### Mobile-Specific Rules
- **No horizontal scrolling.** Nothing should overflow the viewport width. Ever.
- **Minimum tap target size: 44x44px** for all links, buttons, and email addresses. Brokers will tap these with their thumbs.
- **Email links must use `mailto:`** so they open the user's email app on tap.
- **Press release link must open in a new tab** (`target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener"`).
- **Font sizes:** Minimum 16px body text on mobile. Headlines can scale down but must remain readable without zooming.
- **Images must be responsive** — use `max-width: 100%; height: auto;` as a baseline. No fixed-width images.
- **The map image is the trickiest element on mobile.** Test this specifically. If the map text (city names) becomes unreadable when scaled to phone width, add the market list as readable text below the map.
- **No hover-dependent interactions.** Anything revealed on hover (tooltips, image overlays, etc.) must have an alternative on touch devices, or simply be visible by default on mobile.
- **Test on a real phone** (not just browser resize). Open the page on an actual iPhone and Android device before delivering.

## Functional Requirements

### Links and Contact
- **Email addresses** must be wrapped in `<a href="mailto:...">` tags
- **Press release link** must open in a new tab
- **Hanover logo** (top and bottom) must link to https://www.hanoverco.com and open in a new tab
- Verify all links work after redesign

### Meta Tags and SEO
Include these in the `<head>`:
- `<title>` — "Hanover Opportunities Fund | $125M for Land & Commercial Acquisitions"
- `<meta name="description">` — brief summary of the fund's acquisition criteria
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` — **critical for mobile rendering**
- **Open Graph tags** (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`) so the page previews well when the URL is shared in email, LinkedIn, or text messages. Use the Hanover logo or the map image as the `og:image`.

### Favicon
- Add a favicon. Use the Hanover "H" from the logo or a simple branded icon. Provide as both `.ico` and `.png` (for Apple touch icon). If you can't extract one from the logo, a simple navy square with a white "H" is fine.

### Performance
- **Page load under 3 seconds on a 4G mobile connection.** This is a simple page — there's no reason it should be slow.
- Use `loading="lazy"` on images below the fold
- Optimize CSS — no unused frameworks or libraries. If you use a utility framework like Tailwind, purge unused classes.
- Google Fonts: load only the weights you actually use (don't import the entire family)

### Browser Compatibility
Must work correctly on:
- Chrome (desktop + mobile)
- Safari (desktop + iOS)
- Firefox (desktop)
- Edge (desktop)
- Samsung Internet (mobile)

**Safari on iOS is the most important mobile browser to test.** Most of the people viewing this site on their phones will be on iPhones.

### Accessibility Basics
- All images must have `alt` text (the current site already has this — preserve it)
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text)
- Page should be navigable with keyboard (tab through links)
- Use semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<h1>`–`<h3>`)

---

## Technical Requirements

- **Single HTML file** (CSS can be inline or a separate `.css` file)
- **No JavaScript frameworks** (React, Vue, etc.) — vanilla JS only if needed (e.g., for a simple scroll animation)
- **Google Fonts only** (no paid font licenses)
- **All images stay on ImageKit.io and hanoverco.com** — do not download and re-host
- **Deploy-ready for Netlify** — I will push the file(s) to my repo
- **Clean, readable code** — properly indented, with comments on major sections so I can make small text edits myself in the future

---

## Deliverable

A ZIP file or GitHub repo containing:
- `index.html` (the redesigned page)
- `style.css` (if using external stylesheet)
- `favicon.ico` and `favicon.png` (or `apple-touch-icon.png`)
- No other files unless absolutely necessary
- A brief note confirming you tested on:
  - Desktop Chrome
  - iPhone Safari (or iOS simulator)
  - One Android browser

---

## Timeline

2–4 days from mockup approval.

### Milestones
1. **Mockup (Day 1–2):** Deliver a visual mockup (Figma, Canva, screenshot — whatever you prefer) showing the full page layout at desktop AND mobile widths. I approve or request changes before you code.
2. **Coded deliverable (Day 3–5):** Final HTML/CSS files, tested on desktop and mobile, deploy-ready.

## How I'll Evaluate Your Work

I will check these things, in this order:

1. **Mobile experience.** I will open the site on my phone first. If it doesn't look great on mobile, the project is not done.
2. **Does it look/feel like the two reference sites?** The overall visual tone should feel institutional, polished, and confident — like Homestead Capital and Peaceable Street.
3. **Is all the original content preserved exactly?** No missing text, no rewritten copy, no missing images.
4. **Does the stat bar pop?** The $125M / $3M–$20M+ / 19 Markets numbers should be visually prominent.
5. **Do all links work?** Emails open mail app, press release opens in new tab, logo links to hanoverco.com.
6. **Is the code clean?** Can I open the HTML and make a simple text edit (e.g., change a market name) without breaking anything?
7. **Page speed.** Loads fast on mobile.
